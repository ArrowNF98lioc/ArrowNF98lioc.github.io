I am currently an undergraduate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/) at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). Previously, I was a high school student at [Dalian No.24 High School](https://www.dlhs24.com.cn/). At SUSTech, I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io/). Here is my CV. My research interests are broadly in applied mathematics, with a specific focus on developing algorithms for applied scenarios (that I find crucical) and uncovering mathematical structures arising from applications (that I find significant). Feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating with me on some fun projects!
