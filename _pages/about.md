I am currently an undergraduate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/) at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)(SUSTech). Previously, I was a high school student at [Dalian No.24 High School](https://www.dlhs24.com.cn/). At SUSTech, I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io/). Here is my [CV](https://github.com/ArrowNF98lioc/ArrowNF98lioc.github.io/blob/master/files/YuheQin%20CV.pdf). My research interests are broadly in applied mathematics, with a specific focus on developing algorithms for applied scenarios (that I find crucical) and uncovering mathematical structures arising from applications (that I find significant). Feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating with me on some fun projects!

In the future, I plan to expand my website with more content focused on topics such as optimization, computational topology, auditory perception, and the application of Gestalt principles in cognitive science. I aim to explore these subjects in depth, providing insights and resources for those interested in the intersection of these fascinating fields.
