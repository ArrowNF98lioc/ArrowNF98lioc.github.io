From August 5 to 10, 2024, Professor Yifei Zhu led our research group to participate in [SPIRES 2024](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/topological-data-analysis/spires-2024) organized by the Centre for Topological Data Analysis at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK. During the conference, we presented [our findings](https://yifeizhu.github.io/tail.pdf) on topology-enhanced machine learning for speech recognition through a [poster](https://arrownf98lioc.github.io/images/tail-poster.pdf) session, showcasing their work to more than 150 experts and scholars from around the world.
