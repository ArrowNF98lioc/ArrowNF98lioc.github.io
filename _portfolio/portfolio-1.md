From August 5 to 10, 2024, Professor Yifei Zhu led our research group to participate in SPIRES 2024 organized by the Centre for Topological Data Analysis at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK. During the conference, we presented our findings on topology-enhanced machine learning for speech recognition through a poster session, showcasing their work to more than 150 experts and scholars from around the world.
